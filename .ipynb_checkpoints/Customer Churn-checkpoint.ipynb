    "Customer churn, often referred to as churn rate, is a crucial business metric that measures the rate at which customers or subscribers stop doing business with a company during a specific period of time. Churn can occur in various types of businesses, including subscription-based services, retail, telecommunications, and more. It is a significant concern for companies because it represents a loss of revenue and potential damage to a company's reputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Churn can be categorized into two main types:\n",
    "\n",
    "Voluntary Churn: This occurs when customers or subscribers choose to end their relationship with a company for various reasons. Common reasons for voluntary churn include dissatisfaction with the product or service, better offers from competitors, changes in personal circumstances, or a perceived lack of value from the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "Involuntary Churn: Involuntary churn happens when customers are no longer able to continue their relationship with a company due to factors beyond their control. This can include situations like a customer's payment method failing (e.g., expired credit card), service disruptions, or the company terminating the customer's account for policy violations.\n",
    "\n",
    "A high churn rate can be a cause for concern and may indicate underlying problems with a company's products, services, or customer support. Reducing churn is often a priority for businesses, and they may employ various strategies to retain customers, such as improving product quality, offering incentives, providing exceptional customer service, or implementing loyalty programs. Understanding the reasons behind churn and taking proactive measures to reduce it can lead to increased customer retention and overall business growth."
